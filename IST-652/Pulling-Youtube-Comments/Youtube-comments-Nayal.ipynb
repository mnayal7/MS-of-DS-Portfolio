      "        Comment: I have an idea for a new segment on overtime, this might sound confusing so read it slow ya d carefully. One item from a grocery store is brought out and set on the table for the group to examine. Then a second item is brought out to examine.(two items on the table) the group then guesses if the first item brought out is more expensive or less expensive than the second item. The price is revealed and If you guess correctly you get 1 point. Now you take away the first item and bring out a third item.(item 2 &amp; 3 should be on the table)Now the group guesses if the second item is more expensive or less expensive than the third item.  The price is revealed and if you get it right you get a point. Now do this for five rounds(there should be 6 items in total because there were 2 items brought out for the first round). After the five rounds who ever has the most points wins. I don‚Äôt have a name for the segment but I think it could be a cool and fun one to do\n",
